#                                                                              #
#    Implements a detective case system. Each case has related evidence that   #
#    can be obtained throughout the world in the form of a testimony or clue.  #
#  A barebones UI has been included to display all cases and related evidence. #
#                                                                              #
#           - By default, the player is on Case 1.                             #
#           - Evidence are fictional items (not actual bag items)              #
#           - Evidence can be part of multiple cases.                          #

#                             Evidence Definition                              #
#                                                                              #
#       Evidence for cases is defined in its own PBS file: evidence.txt.       #
#         This evidence has a very simple format, which is as follows:         #
#                                                                              #
#  [INTERNALNAME]                                                              #
#  Name = Display Name                                                         #
#  Case = Num1, Num2, Num3                                                     #
#  Use = Short usage text                                                      #
#  Description = A longer description that says what the evidence is for.      #
#  (Testimony = true)                                                          #
#                                                                              #
#  - The internal name is how you'll refer to the evidence (with a colon       #
#    in front of it). For example, if you create a piece of evidence called    #
#    TREASUREMAP, then to add it you'd write Evidence.give(:TREASUREMAP).      #
#  - The case number has to be one or more positive numbers. This means that   #
#    this piece of evidence will show up in the evidence list for those cases. #
#  - The use text is a short piece of text that is displayed when the evidence #
#    is selected in the case UI.                                               #
#  - The description is a longer description of what this evidence is exactly. #
#  - The Testimony field is a boolean (true/false, yes/no, etc) field which    #
#    specifies whether this is testimony-type evidence or not.                 #
#    This field can be left out of the PBS, and will default to false in those #
#    instances.                                                                #
#    The testimony property influences which icon is shown in the case UI.     #
